# Nujan

Nujan is a web browser-based IDE (better remix for TON). Nujan is designed to write, test, compile, deploy, and interact with your smart contract. A developer can write a smart contract from anywhere, on any device without any setup, configuration, or download. Our user-friendly interface, fast compiler, and sharing feature make the process of contract deployment simple, fast, and accessible for all users.
